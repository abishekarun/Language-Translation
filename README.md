## Language Translation

In this project, we try to train a seq2seq model for language translation from english to french.This project was done as part of Neural Network Foundations Nanodegree program at Udacity. 

The Jupyter notebook with final seq2seq model can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/abishekarun/Language-Translation/blob/master/language_translation.ipynb).
